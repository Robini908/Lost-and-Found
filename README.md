## üöÄ Quick Start

For those who want to try out the system quickly, we provide a Docker Compose setup:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/lost-found.git
cd lost-found

# Start with Docker Compose (includes all dependencies)
docker-compose up -d

# Open in your browser
xdg-open http://localhost:8000 || open http://localhost:8000
```

## üõ†Ô∏è System Requirements

- PHP >= 8.1
- MySQL >= 8.0
- Composer >= 2.0
- Node.js >= 16
- NPM >= 8

## üì• Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/lost-found.git
   cd lost-found
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   composer install
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment setup**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

4. **Configure your environment**

   Edit `.env` file to set up:
   - Database connection
   - Mail service
   - Third-party APIs (Twilio, OpenAI, Google Maps)
   - Storage service (S3 or local)

5. **Run migrations and seed database**

   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   php artisan db:seed
   ```

6. **Build assets**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

7. **Start the development server**

   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```

8. **Visit your application at http://localhost:8000**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### External Services

The system relies on several external services that need to be configured:

- **Twilio**: For SMS and WhatsApp notifications
- **OpenAI**: For intelligent text matching
- **Google Maps API**: For location services
- **AWS S3**: For file storage (optional)
- **OAuth Providers**: For social authentication (optional)

Configuration instructions for each service can be found in the [detailed documentation](./docs/configuration.md).

### Scheduled Tasks

Set up a cron job on your server to run Laravel's scheduler:

```bash
* * * * * cd /path-to-your-project && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```

This handles:
- Automatic expiration of old listings
- Match suggestion generation
- Statistics compilation
- Cleanup tasks

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The Lost & Found System follows a modern Laravel architecture with:

- **MVC Pattern**: Clean separation of concerns
- **Repository Pattern**: For data access abstraction
- **Service Layer**: For business logic encapsulation
- **Command Bus**: For background processing
- **Event-driven Components**: For real-time features

A comprehensive architectural overview is available in [our documentation](./docs/architecture.md).

## üìò API Documentation

The system provides a RESTful API for integration with other platforms. API documentation is available:

- [API Reference](./docs/api.md)
- [Swagger UI](http://localhost:8000/api/documentation) (when running locally)

## üß™ Testing

The system includes comprehensive test coverage:

```bash
# Run all tests
php artisan test

# Run specific test suite
php artisan test --testsuite=Feature

# Run with coverage report
php artisan test --coverage
```

- Public API platform for third-party integrations

## ‚ùì FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>How does the matching algorithm work?</b></summary>
Our matching algorithm uses a combination of text similarity analysis, geospatial proximity, and temporal alignment. For text similarity, we use TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity, enhanced with OpenAI's language models for semantic understanding. Location matching uses the Haversine formula for geographic distance calculation.
